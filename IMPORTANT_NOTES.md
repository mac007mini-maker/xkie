# ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes & Things to Know

## üî¥ Critical - Must Do Before Running

### 1. Add Your Kie.ai API Key

**Backend needs your API key to work!**

```bash
cd backend
cp env.example .env
# Edit .env file and add your actual API key
```

The `.env` file should look like:
```env
KIE_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
```

**Where to get API key:**
- Go to https://kie.ai/
- Sign up / Log in
- Go to Settings or API section
- Copy your API key

### 2. Backend URL Configuration

**Flutter app needs to know where backend is!**

Edit `flutter_app/lib/config/api_config.dart`:

```dart
// For iOS Simulator
static const String baseUrl = 'http://localhost:3000';

// For Android Emulator (special IP)
static const String baseUrl = 'http://10.0.2.2:3000';

// For production (after deploying to Vercel)
static const String baseUrl = 'https://your-backend.vercel.app';
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

**Backend:**
```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

**Flutter:**
```bash
cd flutter_app
flutter pub get
```

## üü° Important to Understand

### API Calls Cost Credits

Every API test consumes Kie.ai credits!

- ‚úÖ Images: Low cost (~0.1-0.5 credits)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Audio: Medium cost (~1-5 credits)
- üî¥ Videos: High cost (~5-20 credits)

**Recommendation:**
- Start with image APIs (cheapest)
- Monitor your credit balance at https://kie.ai/
- Don't spam the test button!

### Response Times Vary

Different APIs take different times:

| Type | Typical Time |
|------|-------------|
| Images | 5-15 seconds |
| Audio/Music | 1-2 minutes |
| Videos | 1-3 minutes |

**Be patient!** The loading indicator will show progress.

### This is a Testing App

- ‚úÖ For testing and development
- ‚úÖ No login required
- ‚ùå NOT production-ready
- ‚ùå No rate limiting
- ‚ùå No data persistence (results disappear when closed)

## üü¢ Good to Know

### Debug Mode is Enabled

**What this means:**
- Full error messages shown in app
- Stack traces displayed
- Backend logs all requests
- Debug banner visible in app

**Why it's good:**
- Easy to troubleshoot problems
- Learn from error messages
- Understand API responses

**To disable debug mode (later):**
Edit `flutter_app/lib/main.dart`:
```dart
debugShowCheckedModeBanner: false,
```

### File Upload Limitations

| Type | Max Size | Formats |
|------|----------|---------|
| Images | 10MB | JPG, PNG, WEBP |
| Videos | 100MB | MP4, MOV |

**Upload process:**
1. Select file in app
2. File uploads to Kie.ai
3. Returns URL
4. URL used in API call

### Sample Prompts Included

All APIs have pre-filled sample prompts from Kie.ai documentation:

- **Video prompts** - Epic scenes, nature, actions
- **Audio prompts** - Music descriptions with BPM, style
- **Image prompts** - Detailed scenes, characters, styles

**You can modify them!** They're just examples.

## üîµ Platform Differences

### iOS Simulator
```dart
static const String baseUrl = 'http://localhost:3000';
```
‚úÖ Works out of the box

### Android Emulator
```dart
static const String baseUrl = 'http://10.0.2.2:3000';
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Must use `10.0.2.2` (maps to host's localhost)

### Physical Device
```dart
static const String baseUrl = 'http://192.168.1.XXX:3000';
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Must use computer's IP address
‚ö†Ô∏è Device and computer must be on same WiFi

## üü£ Backend Architecture

### Why Backend is Separate

**Security reasons:**
- API key stays on server
- Never exposed in Flutter app
- Can't be extracted from APK/IPA

**Flexibility:**
- Change backend URL without rebuilding app
- Update API logic without app changes
- Deploy backend independently

### Backend Endpoints Structure

All endpoints follow this pattern:
```
POST /api/{category}/{model}/{action}
```

Examples:
- `/api/video/veo/generate`
- `/api/audio/suno/generate`
- `/api/photo/nano-banana/edit`

## üîß Configuration Files

### Files You Might Need to Edit

1. **backend/.env** - Add your API key
2. **flutter_app/lib/config/api_config.dart** - Backend URL
3. **backend/vercel.json** - Vercel settings (if deploying)

### Files You Probably Won't Edit

- All other files are ready to use
- Only change if you want to customize features

## üåê Deployment Notes

### Vercel Free Tier Limits

- ‚úÖ 100GB bandwidth/month
- ‚úÖ 100GB-hours compute
- ‚úÖ Unlimited requests (with fair use)
- ‚úÖ 1000 serverless functions/day

**This is enough for:**
- Personal testing
- Small team usage
- Development projects

**Not enough for:**
- High-traffic production apps
- Public-facing services
- Heavy concurrent usage

### Production Checklist

Before deploying to production:
- [ ] Add real API key to Vercel env vars
- [ ] Update Flutter baseUrl to production URL
- [ ] Test all APIs in production
- [ ] Monitor credit usage
- [ ] Set up error alerts (optional)

## üí∞ Cost Considerations

### Kie.ai Credits

- You pay for credits at https://kie.ai/
- Different APIs cost different amounts
- Monitor usage in Kie.ai dashboard

### Vercel Hosting

- Free tier is usually enough
- Backend is serverless (no idle cost)
- Only charged when APIs are called

### Flutter App

- Free to build and distribute
- No hosting cost (runs on device)

## üö® Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Forgetting to Start Backend

```bash
# Terminal 1: Backend MUST be running
cd backend
npm run dev
```

### 2. Wrong Backend URL

iOS Simulator: `localhost:3000`
Android Emulator: `10.0.2.2:3000`
Physical Device: `192.168.1.XXX:3000`

### 3. API Key Not Set

Check `backend/.env` exists and has your key!

### 4. Spamming Test Button

- Each click costs credits
- Wait for response before clicking again
- Use loading indicator to know when done

### 5. Not Checking Error Messages

- App shows detailed errors
- Read them to understand issues
- Backend logs also helpful

## üì± App Behavior

### Results Don't Save

- Results disappear when you close app
- This is by design (testing app)
- To save results: Take screenshots
- Future feature: Add persistence

### No Login Required

- Pure testing tool
- No user accounts
- No authentication
- Anyone with app can test (if they have backend URL)

### Debug Info Shows

- Error messages with stack traces
- Request/response data
- Backend logs in terminal
- This helps with testing/debugging

## üîç Troubleshooting Tips

### Backend Issues

**Check if running:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000
# Should return JSON with success: true
```

**Check logs:**
Backend terminal shows all requests:
```
[timestamp] POST /api/photo/nano-banana/generate
üì§ Calling Kie.ai: /v1/image/nano-banana/generate
‚úÖ Response: 200
```

**Check API key:**
```bash
cat backend/.env
# Should show your actual API key
```

### Flutter Issues

**Check backend URL:**
Look in `lib/config/api_config.dart`

**Check logs:**
```bash
flutter run -v
```

**Clean and rebuild:**
```bash
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

### API Issues

**"Invalid API key":**
- Check API key in backend/.env
- Verify key is correct at https://kie.ai/
- Restart backend after changing .env

**"Insufficient credits":**
- Buy more credits at https://kie.ai/
- Check balance in Kie.ai dashboard

**"Request timeout":**
- Some APIs take 1-3 minutes
- Wait for loading indicator
- Check internet connection
